# A Whirlwind Tour of Pandas 

From [pandas.pydata.org](0):

> `pandas` is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source
> data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python
> programming language.

This repository houses a [Jupyter](1) notebook which is a really fun
way to work with code and data in an interactive manner. Specifically,
this notebook will show how to use `pandas` to explore and manipulate
a set of fictitious customer orders.

## How To Use this Repository

You will need to have these software tools installed to get started:
**python3**, **git**, **make** and a web brower.

### Getting Started.

0. Start a web browser (Firefox, Chrome, Mozilla, Safari, etc)

1. Clone the repository to your local host
   ```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/JnyJny/Pandas-Talk.git
   ```
   
2. Install and Start Jupyter Notebook
   ```bash
   $ cd Pandas-Talk
   $ make start
   ```

Your web browser should now display the 'Customers' Jupyter Notebook
page which has commentary woven thru the interactive code.  If this is
your first experience with a [Jupyter Notebook](1), take a look at
the [Notebook UI Overview](2) before going much further.
